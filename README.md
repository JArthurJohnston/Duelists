# Duelists

### Concepts
- Giant Robot duel simulator
    - Giant robot gladitorial combat
    - The player sees themselves in a cockpit, and the oponent is the enemy mech. And theyre only armed with mele weapons
- Different rules of combat for roomscale and stationary play
    - Roomscale, players can move around in a circle/arena
    - stationary, players cant walk around only dodge. essentially the area of play will just be smaller.
    - Players score points if their oponents go out of bounds.
